# TuteDude – DevOps Learning Projects 🚀

Welcome to **TuteDude** – a collection of my hands-on learning projects and experiments while exploring **DevOps tools, cloud platforms, and CI/CD pipelines**.  
This repository is like my personal DevOps lab where I practice, break things, fix them, and document my journey.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each folder represents a separate tool, concept, or project I explored:  

- **AWS** – Basics of cloud computing, IAM, EC2, S3, CLI setup, and more.  
- **Docker** – Containerization experiments, Dockerfiles, images, and simple apps.  
- **Kubernetes** – Learning pods, deployments, services, and configs.  
- **Terraform** – Infrastructure as Code (IaC) experiments to provision AWS resources.  
- **Jenkins** – Setting up jobs, pipelines, and automation workflows.  
- **CircleCI** – CI/CD pipeline configurations with CircleCI.  
- **GitHub Actions** – Automating workflows using Actions.  
- **CI/CD Pipelines** – End-to-end pipeline setups combining different tools.

## 🎯 Goals of This Repo
- Learn DevOps concepts by building **small, practical projects**.  
- Gain confidence in setting up **CI/CD pipelines**.  
- Explore different tools and compare how they solve similar problems.  
- Document my journey for quick reference in the future.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
- **Cloud**: AWS  
- **Containers**: Docker, Kubernetes  
- **IaC**: Terraform  
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, CircleCI, GitHub Actions

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cirarshi/TuteDude.git
   cd TuteDude
    ```
2. Navigate to the folder of your choice (e.g., Docker/, Terraform/).
3. Follow the instructions in the respective folder’s files.

## 📖 Learning Approach

- Start with the basics (Hello World apps, simple scripts).
- Gradually add complexity (multi-container apps, full CI/CD pipelines).
- Focus on hands-on learning rather than just theory.

---

## 🌟 Future Plans

- Add monitoring tools like Prometheus & Grafana.
- Explore Ansible for configuration management.
- Build a complete DevOps project combining all tools.
